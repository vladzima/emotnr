# How to contribute

## Submitting changes

This project uses [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) provided by [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).

1) To commit your changes first run:
```
npm install commitizen -g && npm install -g cz-conventional-changelog
```
2) And then use `git cz` instead of `git commit` (`cz` works with all standard git parameters, [more](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) on the usage). You will be presented with a prompt, please choose your options carefully.

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to emotnr](https://github.com/vladzima/emotnr/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)).
