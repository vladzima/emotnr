# How to contribute

## Submitting changes

This project uses [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) provided by [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).

1) To commit your changes first run:
```
npm install commitizen -g && npm install -g cz-conventional-changelog
```
2) And then use `git cz` instead of `git commit`. You will be presented with a prompt, please choose your options carefully.
